This is a collection of SDL based c files for windows created to have functional SDL tools and for my exploration of using C as a langauge.
These include:
-A very basic image viewer using SDL2 and SDL image libs.
- A image viewer supporting PNGs and JPEGs using SDL2.
-- inlcuding zooming and image manipulation while zoomed.
- A basic 3d render of a cube rotating using SDL2 only.

Use and edit these as you wish under MIT licence.
