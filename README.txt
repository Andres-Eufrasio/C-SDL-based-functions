This is a collection of SDL based c files created to show examples of functional SDL tools and for my exploration of using C as a langauge.
These are meant to be built upon.
These include:
-A very basic image viewer using SDL2 and SDL image libs.
- A image viewer supporting PNGs and JPEGs using SDL2.
-- inlcuding zooming and image manipulation while zoomed.
- A basic 3d render of a cube using SDL2 only.

Required dependencies:
SDL2
SDL_Image
jpeglib
pnglib
